A range of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python

## Arrays & Hashing
### Arrays
Arrays are data structures that store collections of elements in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable which can be accessed using indices.

In Python, arrays are most commonly referred to as lists. They are dynamic and can be used to store elements of different types but are usually used to store elements of the same type.

### Hashing
Hashing is a process used in many data structures like hash tables, hashsets and dictionaries where a key is mapped to a value using a hash function. The hash function takes an input (key) and returns an integer known as a hash value. 

In Python, hashing is heavily utilized in dictionaries and sets.
